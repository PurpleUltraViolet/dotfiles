# My dotfiles

Like it says on the tin - the dotfiles I use for my Arch systems.

If you want to install them for whatever reason, run `make-symlinks.sh`. It
should work. Just try not to run it more than once because then it starts with
symlinks in symlinks and I really don't feel like troubleshooting it.
